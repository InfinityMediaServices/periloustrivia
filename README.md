# Perilous Trivia

A cool React app that uses firebase to make a multi-player trivia game that might remind you of a TV show. For a quick summary see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XuM7RwHRnGOYbEgoKffkqESDnZimkdTTpo4xfdagsag/edit?usp=sharing @arron consider moving this inside the README.md or to a Github Wiki page.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* A contemporary development machine running a recent and stable version of Linux, Windows or OSX
* A basic understanding of bash-like terminals to run some commands. Note that Windows uses a different pathing syntax than *nix, cmd.exe is not recommended. Consider using Powershell or install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and use the supplied Git bash CLI
* @arron to add additional as required

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

``` javascript
Give the example
```

And repeat

``` jsx
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

``` html
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

``` jade
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
